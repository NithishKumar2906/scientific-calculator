A graphical user interface (GUI) based scientific calculator is a type of calculator that uses a graphical interface to interact with the user. The importance of GUI based scientific calculators can be understood in the following ways:

User-friendly interface: GUI based scientific calculators have a user-friendly interface that makes it easier for users to perform mathematical calculations. The interface is designed in a way that makes it easy to understand and use, even for non-technical users.

Improved functionality: Scientific calculators are designed for complex mathematical calculations, and GUI based calculators provide advanced functions like logarithm and trigonometry, making it easier to perform complex calculations.

Customization: GUI based scientific calculators provide users with the ability to customize the interface to their liking, which makes it easier to use and more convenient.

Improved accuracy: Scientific calculators use algorithms to perform calculations, which can result in errors. GUI based calculators often provide error handling mechanisms that make it easier to identify and correct errors.

Portability: GUI based scientific calculators can be used on different platforms, including desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices, making it easier to perform calculations on the go.

Hence, GUI based scientific calculators provide a more user-friendly, functional, customizable, accurate, and portable option for performing complex mathematical calculations.
